# Build and test the pilot gem

The gem packages the same skill, installer, and Ruby helpers as the source checkout.
It adds no runtime gems and does not install a global agent profile. This is a local
prerelease package; nothing has been published to RubyGems.org.

Build from the trusted source directory; RubyGems reads package files relative
to the working directory. With the source installation from the first-use guide:

```bash
cd "$HOME/agent-tools/shakacode-workflows"
gem build shakacode-workflows.gemspec
```

To try the built package without changing your application bundle or normal gem
installation, use a separate gem home. These environment values apply only to the
individual commands:

```bash
sw_gem_home=$(mktemp -d)
GEM_HOME="$sw_gem_home" GEM_PATH="$sw_gem_home" gem install --local --no-document ./shakacode-workflows-0.1.0.pre.1.gem
GEM_HOME="$sw_gem_home" GEM_PATH="$sw_gem_home" "$sw_gem_home/bin/sw" --help
```

Keep this temporary home for packaging checks only. A real pilot installation must
keep its trusted source outside the agent's writable directories, including any
temporary directories the host allows. Do not export the test gem environment into
your application's shell or add the pilot to its Gemfile.

The package also contains `install-agent-workflows --skills-dir DIR`, which calls
the existing explicit-directory installer. Use it only when you want a link in a
chosen skill directory. It preserves existing content and refuses to replace a
different source. The [first-use guide](getting-started.md) explains the trusted
source and host startup boundaries.

## Upgrade, rollback, and removal

RubyGems installs each version in its own directory. A manually installed skill
link keeps pointing to its original version. To change that link, inspect its
destination, remove only the known pilot symlinks, then run the new version's
installer. Do not remove a foreign directory or silently repoint another skill.
You can retain the prior gem version and relink it for rollback.

Remove both pilot skill links (`sw` and `aw`) before uninstalling the version it points to. For the
isolated packaging check above:

```bash
GEM_HOME="$sw_gem_home" GEM_PATH="$sw_gem_home" gem uninstall shakacode-workflows --all --executables
```

A two-version artifact trial also confirmed explicit upgrade and rollback while
preserving an existing skill link. The package test builds and installs the actual gem into a temporary home, runs
the installed helper and installer from outside the source checkout, then removes
the package. Existing installer tests cover repeat installation, collisions, and
source updates. These checks validate the artifact; they do not establish host
compatibility or authorize a registry release.

The provisional name is `shakacode-workflows`, with version `0.1.0.pre.1`. License
and registry release approval remain outstanding. The gemspec does not invent a
license grant, so RubyGems currently warns that a license is unspecified. Packaging
uses [standard RubyGems tooling](https://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/).
