# Install and complete your first task

This guide installs `$aw` in the Codex app or starts a fresh Codex CLI session.
Claude Code and Cursor support remain planned. You do not need to know the previous
workflow pack.

Use this pilot for ordinary changes in a trusted checkout. This recipe does not
establish isolation for executing untrusted contributor code.

## 1. Install the prerequisites

Install [Codex CLI](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/codex/cli#getting-started),
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Ruby 3.4](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/),
and [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). Sign in to Codex and authorize GitHub CLI
for the repository you will work in. Check your terminal:

```bash
codex --version
git --version
ruby --version
gh auth status
```

If GitHub CLI is not signed in, run `gh auth login`. The helper process needs Ruby
3.4 available; keep your application's own Ruby/toolchain settings unchanged.
You do not need Bundler or this project's development gems to use the skill.

## 2. Get the trusted workflow source

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/agent-tools"
git clone https://github.com/shakacode/agent-workflows-v2.git "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2"
git -C "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2" log -1 --oneline
```

Review the source you will run. Keep this checkout separate from the application
you want to change. If it already exists, use the upgrade instructions below.

## 3. Install outside your repositories

### Use $aw in the Codex app

After completing steps 1–2, install into Codex's user skills directory:

```bash
"$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2/bin/install" --skills-dir "$HOME/.agents/skills"
```

In your repository's Codex task, send:

```text
$aw Fix the failing search test
```

A task URL works too. The agent asks for anything missing, including merge
preference when it is unset. The skill should appear on the next turn; if it does
not, restart Codex. The app uses that task's existing permissions. Installing a
skill does not change its sandbox; use the terminal launcher below when you want
its tested startup boundary. Keep the trusted source outside the repository you
are changing.

### Use a fresh Codex terminal session

Use a dedicated directory outside your repositories and global agent profile:

```bash
"$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2/bin/install" --skills-dir "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2-pilot/skills"
```

The installer creates an `aw` link in that directory and refuses to overwrite
another skill. Keep both link and source outside candidate repositories. It changes
no global profile, authentication, hooks, or other skills.

This dedicated directory is for the terminal launcher; it does not register `$aw`
in the Codex app. Choose the user-directory installation above for app discovery.

If you used the earlier project-local instructions, remove that old link only if
it is still a symlink. If Git replaced it with tracked files, do not delete those
files blindly or start a task using them; resolve the conflicting installation first.

Your existing `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/bin/` commands, and workflow configuration stay
in place. The agent uses their setup, validation, and review instructions. If those
commands are undocumented, establish them before implementation; the workflow
source's `bin/validate` is not a substitute for your application's checks.

Installing this skill does not disable other instructions, skills, or hooks. If
you already run another workflow pack, use your host's settings to disable
conflicting workflows for the pilot. A separate checkout alone is not a security
sandbox or an isolated agent configuration.

## 4. Start your terminal task

For the source installation above, expose its command in this terminal:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2-pilot/skills/aw/scripts:$PATH"
```

Run from anywhere inside the repository you want to change:

```bash
aw work "Fix the failing search test"
```

Supply a GitHub issue, Linear link, or task description as the argument. When
starting elsewhere, put `--repo /path/to/your/repository` before the task. Use
`aw work --help` for the command syntax. A packaged installation already supplies
`aw`; see [installing the package](packaging.md).

The launcher identifies your Git checkout and opens native interactive Codex.
Your account, model, and reasoning settings stay native, and questions appear in
the same terminal. The agent reads the task and your repository's instructions;
if a task link is inaccessible, it asks for the missing description. You do not
need a different prompt for each tracker.

If you have not already specified how to handle merging, it asks a question like:

> For this first task, I recommend bringing the finished PR back for your approval.
> Would you prefer that, or should I merge it when the checks and required approvals pass?

That choice applies to this task. Existing instructions are reused; no answer means
the agent can prepare the PR but cannot merge it. Private tracker content stays out
of public PRs unless you authorize sharing it.

<details>
<summary>Startup boundary and current validation</summary>

Each launch creates a private temporary session outside the consumer checkout,
reads the trusted skill by its absolute source path, and directs repository
commands to the checkout. It adds no skill link to that writable session. The
launcher rejects canonical or lexical overlaps between writable paths and the
trusted source or installed command/link parents. If your `TMPDIR` is inside the
target checkout, choose a temporary directory outside it before launching.

The native shell sandbox permits writes in the session and target checkout,
overrides extra writable roots, excludes ambient temporary directories, and uses
approval prompts for this launch. It sets shell `TMPDIR` and zsh `TMPPREFIX`
inside the session's temporary directory. It leaves authentication and model settings
alone. Session scratch stays in the system temporary directory after Codex exits;
the launcher leaves no background process. Codex still shows its native directory
trust and command-approval prompts; the launcher does not bypass them.

On Codex CLI 0.154.0, separate startup and native sandbox probes kept candidate
skill metadata out of the initial prompt and denied writes to the trusted source,
installed link, and link parent while permitting session and checkout writes.
A live terminal trial verified temporary-file access, protected-file write denial,
and automatic native usage discovery. A separate native sandbox check reproduced
and corrected zsh heredoc failures using the session temp prefix. Launcher tests
verify the executed arguments and path refusals. App startup,
other host versions, and complete isolation remain unverified. The sandbox does
not establish that dependencies are trustworthy or remove secrets from published
text. Do not approve an escape merely to make a check pass.

## 5. Know what to expect

The agent resolves important questions, implements on a branch, runs your repo's
checks, opens the PR, explains the change, and handles consequential review findings.
You receive the outcome and PR link; supporting checks and available usage evidence
are in expandable details. Usage is reported on every task, with missing data
marked UNKNOWN. The [native usage reader](usage-reporting.md) collects available
Codex records automatically; complete per-commit attribution remains unverified.

Merging requires observable native GitHub checks enforced for the acting account.
If that setup is missing, the agent can hand over the PR with the reason it cannot
merge. **Ask** requests one merge decision; **Auto** needs no second decision once
the required approvals are satisfied. See [working with your agent](working-with-your-agent.md)
for questions, writing preferences, and security boundaries.

## Upgrade or remove

Upgrade the trusted source, review its changes, then start a new Codex task:

```bash
git -C "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2" switch main
git -C "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2" pull --ff-only
```

Switching to `main` also resumes normal upgrades after a rollback to a detached
commit. Preserve local edits; do not force a switch or discard changes.
The existing link uses the updated source. If you installed the earlier
`work-pr-v2` pilot, remove that link only after confirming it points to this trusted
source, then rerun the installer. Do not delete a directory or an unrelated link.
The skill and its new link are named `aw`; old terminal PATH entries need updating.

For the Codex app, remove only the installed link with:

```bash
test -L "$HOME/.agents/skills/aw" && unlink "$HOME/.agents/skills/aw"
```

For the dedicated terminal installation:

```bash
test -L "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2-pilot/skills/aw" && unlink "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2-pilot/skills/aw"
```

For rollback without removal, point the trusted source checkout at a previously
reviewed revision. Do not overwrite local edits. Other skills and application
configuration are unaffected.
