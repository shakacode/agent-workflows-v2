# Install and complete your first task

This guide uses Codex CLI and installs the skill into a dedicated pilot directory.
Claude Code and Cursor support remain planned. You do not need to know the previous
workflow pack.

Use this pilot for ordinary changes in a trusted checkout. This recipe does not
establish isolation for executing untrusted contributor code.

## 1. Install the prerequisites

Install [Codex CLI](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/codex/cli#getting-started),
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Ruby 3.4](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/),
and [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). Sign in to Codex and authorize GitHub CLI
for the repository you will work in. Check your terminal:

```bash
codex --version
git --version
ruby --version
gh auth status
```

If GitHub CLI is not signed in, run `gh auth login`. The helper process needs Ruby
3.4 available; keep your application's own Ruby/toolchain settings unchanged.
You do not need Bundler or this project's development gems to use the skill.

## 2. Get the trusted workflow source

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/agent-tools"
git clone https://github.com/shakacode/agent-workflows-v2.git "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2"
git -C "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2" log -1 --oneline
```

Review the source you will run. Keep this checkout separate from the application
you want to change. If it already exists, use the upgrade instructions below.

## 3. Install outside your repositories

Use a dedicated directory outside your repositories and global agent profile:

```bash
"$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2/bin/install" --skills-dir "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2-pilot/skills"
```

The installer creates a `work-pr-v2` link in that directory and refuses to overwrite
another skill. Keep both link and source outside candidate repositories. It changes
no global profile, authentication, hooks, or other skills.

Codex will not automatically list this pilot in `/skills`. The prompts below name
the trusted file explicitly. That path alone does not disable repository skill
metadata: use the startup directory in the next step as well.

If you used the earlier project-local instructions, remove that old link only if
it is still a symlink. If Git replaced it with tracked files, do not delete those
files blindly or start a task using them; resolve the conflicting installation first.

Your existing `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/bin/` commands, and workflow configuration stay
in place. The agent uses their setup, validation, and review instructions. If those
commands are undocumented, establish them before implementation; the workflow
source's `bin/validate` is not a substitute for your application's checks.

Installing this skill does not disable other instructions, skills, or hooks. If
you already run another workflow pack, use your host's settings to disable
conflicting workflows for the pilot. A separate checkout alone is not a security
sandbox or an isolated agent configuration.

## 4. Start Codex in a separate working directory

Create a fresh working directory for each new task. Keep the installed link and
trusted source outside both this directory and the target repo. Replace the target path:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2-sessions"
aw_session_dir=$(mktemp -d "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2-sessions/run.XXXXXX")
cd "$aw_session_dir"
codex --sandbox workspace-write --add-dir /absolute/path/to/your/repository
```

Starting inside a candidate repo can load its skill descriptions before your
prompt is read. Starting in the installation directory would make its link writable
by test code. On Codex CLI 0.154.0, we checked that this separate startup keeps
candidate skill metadata out of the initial prompt while including the target
repo as a writable directory. This check used `codex debug prompt-input`; it was
a startup check, not a full agent task. A native workspace sandbox probe also
denied writes to the separate source and installed link while allowing writes in
the working directory and target. App startup, other versions, and complete host
isolation remain unverified.

Keep this session root in the separate working directory; run repository commands
with the target repo as their working directory. Do not start the next task in a
directory writable by the preceding task. The workspace-write sandbox does not
establish that code or dependencies are trustworthy or remove secrets from text
you publish. Do not approve an escape from these boundaries merely to make a check pass.

## 5. Give the agent your task

Paste this into Codex, replacing `<task URL>` with your GitHub issue or Linear link:

```text
Use ~/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2-pilot/skills/work-pr-v2/SKILL.md as the trusted workflow.
Work on <task URL>.
```

You can supply a task description instead of a link. Use the installed path above
in each new task; if you installed elsewhere, change that path. This pilot does
not yet support starting with just `$work-pr-v2`.

The agent reads the task and your repository's instructions. It asks for the
repository path only if it cannot identify the checkout, or for the task description
if it cannot access the link. You do not need a different prompt for each tracker.

If you have not already specified how to handle merging, it asks a question like:

> For this first task, I recommend bringing the finished PR back for your approval.
> Would you prefer that, or should I merge it when the checks and required approvals pass?

That choice applies to this task. Existing instructions are reused; no answer means
the agent can prepare the PR but cannot merge it. Private tracker content stays out
of public PRs unless you authorize sharing it.

## 6. Know what to expect

The agent resolves important questions, implements on a branch, runs your repo's
checks, opens the PR, explains the change, and handles consequential review findings.
You receive the outcome and PR link; supporting checks and available usage evidence
are in expandable details. Usage is reported on every task, with missing data
marked UNKNOWN. Automated collection is still being built.

Merging requires observable native GitHub checks enforced for the acting account.
If that setup is missing, the agent can hand over the PR with the reason it cannot
merge. **Ask** requests one merge decision; **Auto** needs no second decision once
the required approvals are satisfied. See [working with your agent](working-with-your-agent.md)
for questions, writing preferences, and security boundaries.

## Upgrade or remove

Upgrade the trusted source, review its changes, then start a new Codex task:

```bash
git -C "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2" switch main
git -C "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2" pull --ff-only
```

Switching to `main` also resumes normal upgrades after a rollback to a detached
commit. Preserve local edits; do not force a switch or discard changes.
The existing link uses the updated source. To remove only this pilot skill link:

```bash
test -L "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2-pilot/skills/work-pr-v2" && unlink "$HOME/agent-tools/agent-workflows-v2-pilot/skills/work-pr-v2"
```

For rollback without removal, point the trusted source checkout at a previously
reviewed revision. Do not overwrite local edits. Other skills and application
configuration are unaffected.
