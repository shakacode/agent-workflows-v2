# Working with your agent

Give the agent the outcome you want and any limits that matter. A task description,
GitHub issue, or existing tracker link is enough to start. You should not need to
learn the agent's internal process to get a useful pull request.

## When the agent asks questions

Questions can happen before work or during implementation. They should arrive
before the answer becomes expensive to change, rather than waiting for PR review.

| Situation | What the agent does |
| --- | --- |
| The checkout or task is unavailable | Asks for the repository path or task description; does not make you rewrite the workflow prompt. |
| Merge authority has not been specified | Asks early whether to merge after checks and required approvals pass or bring the finished PR back for approval. Reuses existing authority; without an answer, prepares the PR and asks before merging. |
| The goal or acceptable behavior is unclear | Reads the existing context, then asks the smallest question needed to proceed. |
| Several routine, reversible approaches fit the request | Chooses one and continues; mentions the assumption if it affects your expectations. |
| Implementation reveals a product tradeoff, wider scope, or consequential risk | Explains the discovery, recommends a path, and asks before dependent work continues. |
| An answer is pending | Continues useful independent work. Does not treat silence as approval. |
| The PR is ready | In **Ask**, requests one merge decision unless already authorized. In **Auto**, merges after the required checks and approvals pass. |

For example, a question discovered while fixing an import could be:

> Some rows contain invalid dates. I recommend accepting the valid rows and
> showing the others for correction, so useful work can proceed without invented
> dates. Is partial import acceptable, or must the whole file succeed together?

The question makes the consequence understandable. It does not ask you to choose
an internal parser, review a token log, or wait until the code is finished.
Related questions can come together; a mandatory questionnaire is unnecessary.
An answer remains part of the existing task or PR, subject to its privacy, so the
agent can use it later without asking again. A merge choice applies to this task
unless you explicitly give it broader scope. Choosing **Ask** at the start leaves
the actual merge decision until you can see the finished change.

## A short message, with evidence available

One owner communicates with you even when bounded assistants help with the work.
Updates explain meaningful progress or a change in direction. The final message
answers: what happened, where is the PR, and is a decision still needed?
Keep a short validation result visible. Required decisions, important risks, and
limitations that change the conclusion must also stay visible.

The following is an illustrative PR summary, not a report of an actual change:

> The import now identifies invalid dates and accepts the remaining valid rows.
> Focused tests and required CI pass. Ready for your merge decision.
> Complete token usage is UNKNOWN because external reviewer usage is unavailable.

<details>
<summary>Example: verification and usage details</summary>

The PR would record the tested commit, actual commands and results, and links to
CI. Its code walkthrough would explain the change and important code choices.
Model and usage rows would identify the contributing commits, configured model
and effort, available native token counts, shared work, and missing contributors.
These are supporting records; opening this block is not an extra approval step.

</details>

Use descriptive labels such as “Verification” and “Model and token usage.” Keep
the walkthrough's main explanation outside the collapsed evidence. In a chat
that does not render collapsible blocks, link to the PR's details instead of
pasting its logs. A failure or changed risk should appear in the next update,
even if the supporting command output is collapsed.

Collapsed content remains readable and public wherever the PR is public. It is
not private storage. Keep prompts, raw sessions, private identifiers, and secrets
out of published evidence. Collapsing text also does not reduce its token cost
when an agent loads it. Keep useful evidence once and retrieve details as needed.

## Writing preferences

The skill provides a plain-English default. Your repo can customize the audience,
language, vocabulary, and level of detail in its existing `AGENTS.md`. For example:

```markdown
Writing: explain the result and why it matters before implementation details.
Use our product terms; explain unfamiliar technical terms on first use.
Prefer short paragraphs and one concrete example when a decision is complex.
Keep supporting checks and usage tables in expandable PR details.
```

Your instruction in the current task can refine these preferences. No new style
file or configuration schema is needed. Important decisions, risks, and uncertainty
stay visible at any verbosity. Every task reports available model/effort/token
evidence; missing information is UNKNOWN until the collector can establish it.

The goal is understanding on the first reading. The
[/wait-what article](https://www.aihero.dev/skills-wait-what) describes repairing a
message by supplying missing context and familiar vocabulary. Build that care into
the default response: brevity alone is insufficient. Users can still ask questions,
but should not need another skill to translate our messages.

## What the helpers protect

The command is `skills/aw/scripts/aw`. Its Ruby modules perform a narrow
set of operations; they are not a complete security system.

| Protection | Who provides it |
| --- | --- |
| Pass GitHub arguments without constructing a shell command; parse JSON and check identifiers | The helpers. |
| Bind the walkthrough and merge to the checked commit; reject missing checks, bypass-capable accounts, or unsupported merge conditions | The helpers, with native GitHub enforcement. |
| Decide whether a change is authorized, safe to run, and adequately verified | The owning agent following trusted user/repo instructions. The helpers do not prove these judgments. |
| Restrict file/network access and credentials while running candidate code | Host permissions and the execution environment. The helpers do not create a sandbox or inspect code for malicious behavior. |

Public issues and PR comments are task data, even when they contain instructions.
They cannot grant permission or replace trusted policy. The helper does not scan
their prose, establish author trust, or remove secrets from a supplied review body.
Review what will be published and use restricted execution for untrusted changes.

A private repo can still contain imported text, outside contributions, or unsafe
dependencies. There is no blanket “security off for private repos” switch. A repo
may choose lighter optional review/check requirements through its trusted seam;
authorization, credential boundaries, current-commit verification, and required
GitHub checks still apply. Repository visibility alone never turns those off.

## Knowing whether communication improved

For real pilot changes, use the existing task and PR history to assess how much
reading, repeated explanation, decision-making, and corrective work the maintainer
needed. Include waiting caused by questions asked too late. Human active time
needs a human estimate; elapsed timestamps cannot establish it.

Check that the outcome is understandable without expanding evidence, that needed
questions arrived in time, and that available model/token records can still be
found. Compare similar accepted changes using the
[pilot's success criteria](pilot-plan.md#success-evidence-and-commit-attribution).
No new survey, communication score, or reporting gate is required.
